    Creating new items
The ItemData resource is what is responsible for everything that is regarding the item.

You can use item.tscn to put out items into the world. But it will not have any meshes or colliders. ItemData is responsible for adding meshes, textures and colliders. If you add any of those things, the parameters in item.tsch instance will be overwritten.

Create a new ItemData resource and name the resource something appropriate. Make sure to fill out all the fields so the item will work as intended. If the mesh and collider are too big, you can always edit the scale of the mesh and collider directly.

There is an empty_data.tres file. Do not remove or use it unless you know what you are doing as it is used to fill empty slots.
